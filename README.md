# virtual-pet-shelter

Created The Lair for user to care and manage intake/outake of creatures residing within the caves.

Users are able to add or remove creatures from The Lair.

Levels are unable to go below 0.  The higher levels, the worse condition of the creatures.  When one level is chosen, it will also cause other levels to be effected.  There are 4 levels the user must tend to:
*Hunger Level
*Thirst Level
*Magic Level
*Boredom Level

The game operates on a continuous loop.  Each time the user interacts with the main menu, the a tick effect is applied which increases each levels on all creatures.  The game will end when either all creatures have been killed or the user opts to end the game through the system menu.
